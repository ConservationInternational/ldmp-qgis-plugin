--------------------------------------------------------------

The Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox supports development of baselines and 
monitoring of land degradation using an innovative desktop and cloud-based 
system.

This is the documentation for the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox. The 
toolbox was produced as part of the project "Enabling the use of global data 
sources to assess and monitor land degradation at multiple scales", funded by 
the Global Environment Facility.
