|trends.earth| (formerly the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox) is a platform 
for monitoring land change using an innovative desktop and cloud-based system.

The three sub-indicators for monitoring achievement of Land Degradation 
Neutrality (LDN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3), are supported 
by |trends.earth|: productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon.  The tool 
also  supports reporting to the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification (UNCCD).

|trends.earth| allows users to plot time series of key indicators of land 
change (including degradation and improvement), and to produce maps and other 
graphics that can support reporting, and tracking the impact of sustainable 
land management or other projects.

The documentation and training materials, including a number of demonstration 
videos, are available on this website:
