**Monitor Indicators for SDG 15.3 and Land Degradation Reporting**

The Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox supports development of baselines and 
monitoring of land degradation using an innovative desktop and cloud-based 
system.

The toolbox supports monitoring indicators for Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) Target 15.3.1 (land degradation neutrality) including productivity, land 
cover, and soil organic carbon, and also supports reporting to the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

The toolbox also allows users to plot time series of key indicators, and to 
produce maps and other graphics that can support tracking the impact of 
sustainable land management or other projects.

The documentation and training materials, including a number of demonstration 
videos, are available on this website:
