Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox
===================================

**Monitor Indicators for SDG 15.3 and Land Degradation Reporting**

The Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox supports development of baselines and 
monitoring of land degradation using an innovative desktop and cloud-based 
system.


The toolbox supports monitoring indicators for Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) Target 15.3.1 (land degradation neutrality) including productivity, land 
cover, and soil organic carbon, and also supports reporting to the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

The toolbox also allows users to plot time series of key indicators, and to 
produce maps and other graphics that can support tracking the impact of 
sustainable land management or other projects.

The toolbox was produced as part of the project "Enabling the use of global 
data sources to assess and monitor land degradation at multiple scales", funded 
by the Global Environment Facility.

Contributors to the documentation and toolbox include Yengoh Genesis [1]_, 
Mariano Gonzalez-Roglich [2]_, Monica Noon [2]_, Lennart Olsson [1]_, Tristan 
Schnader [2]_, Anna Tengberg [1]_, and Alex Zvoleff [2]_.

The Land Degradation Monitoring Project is a partnership of Conservation 
International, Lund University, and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), and is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

The toolbox uses `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com>`_ to 
compute indicators in the cloud.
