Installing the toolbox
=============================

There are different ways to install the toolbox, depending on whether you want 
to install the stable version (recommended) or the development version.

Installing the stable version
-----------------------------
The preferred way to install the toolbox is through QGIS. To install from 
within QGIS, first launch QGIS, and then go to `Plugins` in the menu bar at the 
top of the program and select `Manage and install plugins`.

Then search for a plugin called `Land degradation monitoring tool` and select 
`Install plugin` at the bottom right of the screen.

If your plugin has been installed properly, there will be a toolbox in the top 
left of your browser that looks like this:

Installing the development version
----------------------------------

There are two ways to install the development version of the plugin. For more 
details, see the `README 
<https://github.com/ConservationInternational/ldmp-qgis-plugin#development-version>`_ 
for the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox.
