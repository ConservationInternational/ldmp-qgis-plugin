Before installing the toolbox
==============================

Before installing the toolbox, QGIS version |qgisMinVersion| or higher
needs to be installed on the computer.

.. warning::
   QGIS 3 is not currently supported by |trends.earth|, so the plugin will not 
   appear in the plugin window if you are using QGIS 3. To use |trends.earth| 
   you must install QGIS version 2.18. The Trends.Earth team is aware of this 
   issue and is actively working on a new version of the plugin that will
   support QGIS 3.
