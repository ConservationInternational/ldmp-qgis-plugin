Reporting Tool
==================================
To view the `Reporting Tool`, select the chart icon (|iconChart|). This will open up the `Land degradation reporting` dialog box:

Using the analyses from the former set of steps (under the `Calculate indicators` tab), there is a set of outputs currently displayed within the QGIS window. Select the Reporting Tool in trends.earth. The Land degradation reporting window will appear. Click on SDG Target 15.3.1 Indicator to aggregate the analyses.

The output layer can be selected using the existing layers within the map: 
Productivity trajectory trend (significance), productivity performance (degradation), Productivity state and Land Cover (degradation).

Then select where the output will be saved and the area of interest for the final degradation map. This analysis is run locally in QGIS and will automatically appear in your map window.

A pop up will appear showing the link where the reporting table is saved on your computer. Click `Ok`.    
A plot will appear with the a bar chart of the area degraded, stable, improved and no data  for the areas selected for your analyses.

The final spatial output will appear with areas degraded, stable or improved.

Navigate to the folder where the results are saved and open the spreadsheet `reporting_table.xls`
This will show three tables:

1)	Land use/cover category by area (km)
a.	Area in 2000 for each category
b.	Area in 2015 for each category
c.	Net area change
d.	Net land productivity dynamics (declining, stablem increasing, no data)
e.	Soil organic carbon (2000)

2)	Changes in land use/cover category
a.	Calculates trends (declining, stable, increasing, total) for each land cover transition
3)	Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) 0-30 cm (2000-2015) 
a.	Calculates SOC for the land cover transitions (km2, ton/ha 2000 and 2015, total ton 200 and 2015 and total loss (ton).
