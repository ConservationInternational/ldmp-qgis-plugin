==================================
To view plotted time series, select the graph icon (|iconGraph|). 
This will open up the `Plot data` dialog box:

The toolbox also supports plotting time series showing how a particular indicator has changed 
over time. To use this feature, click on the Plot data button from the toolbox bar. Then select 
a dataset, indicator, and area to plot:

When all the parameters have been defined, click Calculate, and the task 
will be submitted to Google Earth Engine for computing. When the task is 
completed (processing time will vary depending on server usage, but for 
most countries it takes only a few minutes most of the time), youâ€™ll 
receive an email notifying you of the successful completion of the task.

Use the Download tool described above to download and plot the results:
