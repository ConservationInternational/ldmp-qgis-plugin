Using the analyses from the former set of steps (under the Calculate indicators tab), there is a 
set of outputs currently displayed within the QGIS window. Select the Reporting Tool in the LDMT. 
The Land degradation reporting window will appear. Click on SDG Target 15.3.1 Indicator to 
aggregate the analyses.

The output layer can be selected using the existing layers within the map: 
Productivity trajectory trend (significance), productivity performance (degradation), Productivity 
emerging) and Land Cover (degradation).

Then select where the output will be saved and the area of interest for the final degradation map. 
This analysis is run locally in QGIS and will automatically appear in your map window.
