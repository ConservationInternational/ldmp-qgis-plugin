Before installing the toolbox
=============================

Before installing the toolbox, QGIS version 2.18 or higher (64 bit) needs to be 
installed on the computer. QGIS can be downloaded from: 
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html. Once the installer is 
downloaded from the website, it needs to be run (double click on it). Select 
the options using the Default settings.
