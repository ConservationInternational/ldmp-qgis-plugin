Compute urban area change
--------------------------------------------   
1.	Select the Calculate icon (|iconCalculator|) from the Trends.Earth plugin in QGIS.

   :align: center   

2. The **Calculate Indicators** menu will open. In that window, click on **Urban change and land consumption indicators (SDG indicator 11.3.1)** button.

3. Select Step 1: Calculate urban change spatial layers

4. The **Calculate Urban Area Change Metrics** menu will open. In that window, you will step through the four tabs to set the parameters for your analysis.

Before you begin filling out these settings, you may wish to explore your area of interest using the interactive `Urban Mapper page <https://geflanddegradation.users.earthengine.app/view/trendsearth-urban-mapper>`_

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`urban_mapper` section of this manual for a detailed 
    explanation of how each of these sub-indicators is computed in 
    |trends.earth|

5. Settings

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_indicators_settings.PNG
   :align: center
   
By default your window will be open on the Settings tab. 
A. Select the Impervious Surface Index (ISI) by choosing a value between 0-100. The higher the value the smaller the urban area.
B. Select the Night Time Lights Index (NTLI) by choosing a value between 0-100. The higher the value the smaller the urban area.
C. Select the Water Frequency (WF) by choosing a value between 0-100. The higher the value the larger the urban area.

6. Advanced

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_indicators_advanced.PNG
   :align: center

Click Next from the Settings tab to view the Advanced tab. Here you will need to define the thresholds for suburban and urban built up areas.
A. Define the area of largest captured open space (ha) which is the contiguous captured open space larger than this area that will be considered rural.
B. Select which population density dataset you would like to use for the analysis.

7. Area

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_indicators_area.PNG
   :align: center

Click Next from the Advanced tab to view the Area tab. Here you will need to define the area for your analysis.

    country.

You can select a country, region or city from the dropdown lists or upload an area from a file. If you select a city or upload a point location of a city, apply a buffer to the chosen area so that analysis encompasses all potential urban areas.

8. Options

Name the task and some note on how you customized the parameters for your analysis for future reference.
When all the parameters have been defined, click "Calculate", and the task will be submitted to Google Earth Engine for computing. When the task is 
completed (processing time will vary depending on server usage, but for most countries it takes only a few minutes most of the time), youâ€™ll receive an 
email notifying the successful completion.

9. Download results

Urban Mapper
--------------------------------------------   
The Urban Mapper tool in GEE allows users to explore how changing different parameters impact the final output. Here we look at Kampala, Uganda:

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper1.PNG
   :align: center
   
To get a better look at the fine details of the layers, we can zoom in to an area with the default parameters (ISI-20, NTLI-10, WF-25):

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper2.PNG
   :align: center
   
Explore the changes to the map layers with changes to the Night-time lights parameter (ISI-20, NTLI-2, WF - 25)

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper3.PNG
   :align: center
   
See how this changes with a higher Impervious Surface value (ISI-30, NTLI-2, WF-25)

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper4.PNG
   :align: center
   
The area considered urban has decreased in size. Change the Impervious Surface to a lower number to see how it impacts the urban area (ISI-10, NTLI-2, WF-25)

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper5.PNG
   :align: center
   
Zoom out to view the impact of these changes on the overall urban area in Kampala (ISI-10, NTLI-2, WF-25)

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper6.PNG
   :align: center
   
In contrast, we can look at Dubai, an arid city.

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper8.PNG
   :align: center
   
Adjusting the parameters we can see that Dubai would require a different set of parameters than Kampala (ISI-35, NTLI-5, WF-25)

.. image:: /static/documentation/urban/calc_urban_mapper7.PNG
   :align: center
   
Change the Water frequency parameter to see the impact on the man-made islands of Dubai(ISI-35, NTLI-5, WF-80)
