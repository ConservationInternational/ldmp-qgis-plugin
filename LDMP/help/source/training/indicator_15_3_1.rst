SDG Indicator 15.3.1
====================

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 is to:

    Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, 
    sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land 
    degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Part of this goal is Land Degadation Neutrality (LDN). SDG Indicator 
15.3.1 ("proportion of land that is degraded over total land area") is the 
indicator to monitor achievement of LDN. The United Nations Convention to 
Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has developed a `Good Practice Guidance (GPG) 
<http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-10/Good%20Practice%20Guidance_SDG%20Indicator%2015.3.1_Version%201.0.pdf>`_. 
providing recommendations on how to calculate SDG Indicator 15.3.1.

This document provides a brief introduction to SDG Indicator 15.3.1 and 
describes how each indicator is calculated by earth.trends.
