msgid "Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 intends to combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. In order to address this, we are measuring primary productivity, land cover and soil carbon to assess the annual change in degraded or desertified arable land (% of ha). The “Calculate indicators” button brings up a page that allows calculating datasets associated with the three SDG Target 15.3 sub indicators. For productivity and land cover, the toolbox implements the Tier 1 recommendations of the Good Practice Guidance lead by CSIRO. For productivity, users can calculate trajectory, performance, and state. For Land Cover, users can calculate land cover change relative to a baseline period, and enter a transition matrix indicating which transitions indicate degradation, stability, or improvement."
