msgid "The first step before analyzing urban change is to define the extent of built up areas. For that, we have created an interactive web interface called `Trends.Earth Urban Mapper <https://geflanddegradation.users.earthengine.app/view/trendsearth-urban-mapper>`_. This step is fundamental to make sure that the built up area identified by the indicators accurately reflects the conditions in your area of study. The Urban Mapper tool in GEE allows users to explore how changing different parameters impact the extent of the built up area data which will be then used to define changes in urban extent."

msgid "We can easily identify large square boundaries in the built up area data set which do not seem to match the spatial pattern displayed by the background satellite image. That is a sign that the Night time light indicator is set too high (i.e. it is removing from our built-up area map zones with low levels of light which should be included). This is a common situation in suburban areas with low levels of light. If we want to include those areas, we need to lower the value of the NTLI. In this case we'll try changing it from 10 to 2, and click **Run Analysis** again (ISI-20, NTLI-2, WF - 25)."

msgid "If we consider that the overall extent of the built-up area shown in the map is correct, but that the density is too high, we can use the Impervious Surface Indicator to adjust it. If we increase the value of the ISI from 20 to 30, and click **Run analysis** a new layer will display showing overall lower levels of built-up. This happens because we are saying the tool \"only consider built-up areas which have a value of impervious surface indicator of 30 or higher\", so the higher we set this value to, the smaller the built-up area our map will display. The example we just run (ISI-30, NTLI-2, WF-25) would look something like this:"
