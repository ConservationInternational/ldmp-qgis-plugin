# Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox (LDMT)

`ldmp-qgis-plugin` is the github repository for the Land Degradation Monitoring
Toolbox (LDMT). The LDMT is produced by the Land Degradation Monitoring
Project. The LDMT is a [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](http://www.qgis.org/) plugin used
to support monitoring of status and trends of land degradation.

This toolbox was produced as an output of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF)-funded project “Enabling the use of global data sources to assess and
monitor land degradation at multiple scales”. The project aims to provide
guidance on robust methods and a toolbox for assessing, monitoring status, and
estimating trends in land degradation using remote sensing technology. For
additional information on the project see http://vitalsigns.org/gef-ldmp.

The Land Degradation Monitoring Project is a collaboration of Conservation
International, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and
Lund University.
