Installing the toolbox
=============================

There are different ways to install |trends.earth|, depending on whether you want 
to install the stable version (recommended) or the development version.

.. warning::
   QGIS 3 is not currently supported by |trends.earth|, so the plugin will not 
   appear in the plugin window if you are using QGIS 3.0. To use |trends.earth| 
   you must install QGIS version 2.18. See :ref:`before-installing` for more 
   information.

Installing the stable version (recommended)
-------------------------------------------
The preferred way to install the |trends.earth| is through QGIS. To install from 
within QGIS, first launch QGIS, and then go to `Plugins` in the menu bar at the 
top of the program and select `Manage and install plugins`.

the bottom right of the screen.
