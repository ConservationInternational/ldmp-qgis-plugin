msgid "By selecting \"Add Basemap\", the user can select the first or second level administrative boundary. The first level is the country boundary. The second level will be the first sub-division that the country is divided into and will be dependent on the country selected. For example, in the United States of America, the second level will provide a drop down of states. In Kenya, the second level will display provinces. Please note the disclaimer in the window. Natural Earth provides the spatial layers contained within the dropdown. These boundaries are not official endorsed by CI or other partner organizations and contributors. After selecting the dropdown, for the first level and second level if applicable, select \"Ok\"."
